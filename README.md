# MorphUI (WIP)

A modern, open source React UI kit for DuckyHQ projects.

This UI kit uses depth by adding shadows, gradients, and glass morphism effects. It's intended for dark mode only design, and it's fully accessible.

Built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Radix Primitives](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

### This project is unfinished!

It's not usable yet. Figma design file with components is [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1322693203140901897/morphui-wip). (also unfinished)
